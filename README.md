# FaceandEyeRecognizer
Recognizing Face and Eye from the video input

The Project Uses OpenCV and takes haarcascade images as the input

The Project intends to recognize the face and eyes in recatangular boxes dynamically through the webcam/video input

The Code consists of the smile recognition too but it has to be further tuned for better smile recognition.
